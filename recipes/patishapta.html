    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup refined flour (maida)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semolina (sooji)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup coconut (grated)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup khoya (reduced solidified milk)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup jaggery (grated)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>Ghee or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine refined flour, semolina, milk, and water. Mix well to form a smooth batter. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together grated coconut, khoya, jaggery, and cardamom powder to make the filling.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick pan or a griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with ghee or oil.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the pan, swirling it to spread thinly and evenly.</li>
        <li>Allow the crepe to cook until the edges start to lift. Place a portion of the filling along one side of the crepe.</li>
        <li>Carefully fold the crepe over the filling to form a roll or a semi-circular shape.</li>
        <li>Cook until the crepe is golden brown on both sides. Repeat the process for the remaining batter and filling.</li>
        <li>Serve Patishapta warm, garnished with additional grated coconut or drizzled with jaggery syrup if desired.</li>
